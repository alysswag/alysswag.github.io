<h1>WORK IN PROGRESS!!!</h1>
<p style="color: white;">no, really, it's a work in progress, you know? so you could like, you know, go back or something. yeah? hmm? wip? you know what that means? no? it means work in progress, get it? and work in progress means this website isn't finished. so go back, will you?</p>
<a href="../index.html" style="color: white;">go back</a>
<p style="color: white;">still here? still don't get it? okay. let me put this in a way you can understand: let's imagine you're driving down a road, okay? and you notice a sign saying "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" in the middle of it. beyond that sign, the road turns into some sort of weird dirt crater, and there are people in there doing weird stuff. so, what do you do? do you keep driving in that direction? NO! because that part of the road is under construction, and you're gonna crash and burn and kill people! so, like any normal, sensible person would do, you go back and drive a different direction. you get it now? hm? mhm? mhm. *sigh* do you truly not just get it? really? what are you. okay then. one more time? one more time. wip means work in progress. work in progress means this page isn't finished. this page isn't finished means there's nothing to see here. there's nothing to see here means go back. go back means get out. get out means GET OUT!!!!!! GET OUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!!!!!!!! GET OUUUUUUUUUUTTT!!!!!!!</p>
